What is your exposure to building web applications that leverage AI/ML Models? How is the ML model integrated with the application? Please describe using a project you have worked on.
 
Currently I am working as a Chatbot development team in which we have made Alexa as a channel for customer support. We have created multiple skills in the Alexa platform, which are trending for weeks together. 

We have implemented the Alexa NLP to understand the queries from the customer and also used Machine Language to leverage the model training. As we cant train Alexa NLP model with all possibilities manually, we Engineered a ML engine that continuously monitor the Fallback that is happening in Live skill and convert those fallback into appropriate Intents .

we also used ML to identify the word cloud and possible sentence formation which is used to test the Voice skill
